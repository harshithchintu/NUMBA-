# NUMBA- Diagonostics

In todayâ€™s fast-changing field of computational science and research, the speed of parallel processing is essential to solve ever growing and more complicated problems combining large amounts of data. This project focuses on exploring why parallel processing is crucial and how it can be maximized in the language of Python while focusing on Numba, a JIT compiler that improves computational velocity in Python. Numba can be used to enhance or even bring down computations times. For the purpose of understanding the utilization of threading and multiprocessing in Numba, we identify and evaluate the times and scenarios in which these parallel processing strategies are beneficial in enhancing the speed of typical tasks. The project encompasses how to incorporate Numba into Python environments. The results, therefore, highlight Numba as a powerful tool in parallel computation, and shed light into its acquired practical viability and durability for developers and researchers in need of a boost in their computational straightforwardness.
